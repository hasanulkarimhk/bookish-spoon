<!-- Here I will code everything 'Input' element has to offer and make uses of that. Ex:
                                    I. Take a number and do all kind of mathematical calculations with that.
                                    II. Then take a text and print that on the webpage
                                    III. Take text and print that on the webpage in preferred font style.
                                    IV. It will take multiple inputs and will do mathematical calculations.
That's it for now, more things next time. -->
